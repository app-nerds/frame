# Frame Front-end Library

The **Frame Front-end Library** is the App Nerds JavaScript component and CSS library. It contains reusable JavaScript components and styles for building website and applications. All code is pure ES6 JavaScript and CSS3. It  is designed to work well with applications using the Go Frame framework.

*Note that there is an external dependency on [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) for adding icons to your application.*
